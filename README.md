Sprong is a game that I and a few classmates developed for our grade twelve computer science final. We were given free range on what we would like to work on, so we decided to make a mobile game. The game has been downloaded dozens of times on both the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store. I worked on the Android version of the game independently, and this is the source code.

The source code was once affilated with the organization "Almost Done Games".
